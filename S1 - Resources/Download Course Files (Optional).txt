Download Course Files (Optional)
The course files are available for download in this lesson.

Please note that these course files are optional. You can proceed through the entire course by creating new _spec.rb files in the spec directory of the folder we created in the last lesson.

There are two options available. 

rspec-course.zip contains the completed course files with all the code I wrote while recording the lessons.

rspec-course-incomplete.zip contains the same files but stripped of any code.

I strongly recommend downloading rspec-course-incomplete.zip and writing out the Ruby / RSpec code yourself as you complete the videos. No amount of tutorials can substitute for real practice.
